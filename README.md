**Architectural Planning & Microservices Breakdown**
**Service Decomposition**:
1. User Service: Handles user operations and authentication.
2. Expense Service: Manages all endpoints related to expense entry, updates, deletion, and querying past expenses.
3. Group/Settlement Service: Manages group creation, member management, and settlement calculations.
3. Notification Service: Deals with asynchronous notifications and alerts.

**Future services**:
Third-Party/Payment Integration:
Payment Gateway Integration: Enabling users to complete settlements online.
Reporting and Analytics:
Data Export/Visualization: Provide downloadable CSV reports or visual graphs of expenses over time.
API Gateway: Use Spring Cloud Gateway to route client requests to the appropriate microservice.
Inter-Service Messaging: Consider lightweight messaging (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ) for notifying relevant services about events like a new expense being added.
